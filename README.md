# Predicting Aircraft Engine RUL with Machine Learning<br />

This project focuses on predicting the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of aircraft engines using deep learning and feature selection techniques. The dataset used is from the **NASA C-MAPSS** repository, and the project explores several approaches for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.<br />
